"Lots of people working in cryptography have no deep concern with real "
"application issues. They are trying to discover things clever enough to "
"write papers about."
msgstr "许多从事密码学工作的人对实际的应用问题并没有深入的关注。他们只是想找到一些足够深度的东西以便来撰写论文。"

"This book is intended as an introduction to cryptography for programmers of "
"any skill level. It's a continuation of a talk of the same name, which was "
"given by the author at PyCon 2013."

"The structure of this book is very similar: it starts with very simple "
"primitives, and gradually introduces new ones, demonstrating why they're "
"necessary. Eventually, all of this is put together into complete, practical "
"cryptosystems, such as TLS, GPG and :term:`OTR`."
msgstr ""
"本书的结构非常相似：它从非常简单的原语开始，逐步介绍新的，并说明为什么它们是必要的。最终，所有这些一起组合成完整的、实用的密码系统，如TLS、GPG和 "

"The goal of this book is not to make anyone a cryptographer or a security "
"researcher. The goal of this book is to understand how complete "
"cryptosystems work from a bird's eye view, and how to apply them in real "
"software."
msgstr "本书的目标不是让所有人都成为密码学家或安全研究人员。本书的目标是以鸟瞰似地理解完整的密码系统是如何工作的，以及如何在实际软件中应用它。"

"The exercises accompanying this book focus on teaching cryptography by "
"breaking inferior systems. That way, you won't just “know” that some "
"particular thing is broken; you'll know exactly *how* it's broken, and that "
"you, yourself, armed with little more than some spare time and your favorite"
" programming language, can break them. By seeing how these ostensibly secure"
" systems are actually completely broken, you will understand *why* all these"
" primitives and constructions are necessary for complete cryptosystems. "
"Hopefully, these exercises will also leave you with healthy distrust of DIY "
"cryptography in all its forms."
msgstr ""
"本书所附的练习侧重于通过破解低安全等级的系统来教授密码学。这样一来，你就不仅仅是 \"知道 "
"\"某些特定的东西被破解了；你将确切地知道它是如何被破解的，而你自己，只需要一些空闲时间和你最喜欢的编程语言，就可以破解它们。通过知道这些表面上安全的系统实际上是如何被完全破解的，你将理解*为什么*所有这些原语和构造对于完整的密码系统是必要的。希望这些练习也会让你以后对各种形式的DIY加密方法有充分的不信任感。"

"For a long time, cryptography has been deemed the exclusive realm of "
"experts. From the many internal leaks we've seen over the years of the "
"internals of both large and small corporations alike, it has become obvious "
"that that approach is doing more harm than good. We can no longer afford to "
"keep the two worlds strictly separate. We must join them into one world "
"where all programmers are educated in the basic underpinnings of information"
" security, so that they can work together with information security "
"professionals to produce more secure software systems for everyone. That "
"does not make people such as penetration testers and security researchers "
"obsolete or less valuable; quite the opposite, in fact. By sensitizing all "
"programmers to security concerns, the need for professional security audits "
"will become more apparent, not less."

"长期以来，密码学一直被认为是专家的专属领域。从多年来我们看到的许多大公司和小公司的内部泄密事件来看，这种做法显然是弊大于利。我们不能再把这两个世界严格分开了。我们必须将它们联合成一个世界，让所有的程序员都接受信息安全的基础教育，这样他们就可以和信息安全专业人员一起为大家生产更安全的软件系统。这并不会使渗透测试人员和安全研究人员等人变得过时或降低价值，事实上恰恰相反。通过提高所有程序员对安全问题的意识，专业安全审计的需求将变得更多，而不是减少。"
